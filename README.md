This code snippet showcases a collection of controller functions designed to facilitate the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficiently managing reservations of accommodations. Developed with the popular Express.js framework, these functions provide a robust and scalable solution for handling reservation-related tasks.

The functions are implemented using best practices and leverage the express-validator package for input validation, ensuring that data integrity and security are maintained throughout the reservation management process. With these functions, developers can easily create new reservations, retrieve existing ones, update reservation details, and delete reservations when necessary.

By using this code snippet as a foundation, developers can save time and effort in implementing reservation functionality in their web applications. It promotes code reusability and follows industry standards, enabling seamless integration with other components of the application stack.

Overall, this code snippet serves as a valuable resource for developers seeking to build reservation management systems or incorporate reservation features into their applications. Its clean and organized structure, coupled with the use of Express.js and express-validator, provides a solid foundation for efficient and secure reservation handling.
